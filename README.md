    <p>U can access the website via the <a href="https://gamesphere-ahm7.onrender.com/home" target="_blank">link</a> or download the project an run it locally. I have used SUPABASE to host my postgreSQL database and Render to host my website. Note that RENDER is a free service hence, it might sometimes take 20-30s to load. Please have patience.</p>
